# Working in tengen_gba_port/

Port of Tetris (NES, Tengen) to GBA. Goal: 1:1 gameplay and graphics for the
playfield itself; the surrounding HUD is redesigned to fit the GBA's narrower
screen (see `reference/NOTES.md`'s resolution-mapping section for the exact
numbers — short version: the framed 96×160px playfield fits the GBA's 160px
height exactly with zero scaling, and `make gba-check` asserts that against a
running ROM; only the side panels need reflowing).

## Ground rules for this project specifically

1. **The disassembly is the source of truth, not general Tetris knowledge.**
   Tengen's version has real, documented quirks (a randomizer with no
   anti-repeat, a rotation system that only ever kicks one column left, an
   auto-rotate feature bound to holding A/B, specific DAS timing) that differ
   from both the Nintendo-published NES Tetris and from modern guideline
   Tetris. Before implementing or changing a rule, check `reference/NOTES.md`
   first — it's a curated index of what's already been traced in
   `reference/disasm/main.asm.txt`, with exact line numbers. If a mechanic
   isn't there yet, that file's disassembly (11,944 lines) is the place to
   look, not a Tetris wiki or memory of how another version works. External
   sources (tetris.wiki, harddrop.com — both linked in
   `reference/disasm/README.md.txt`) are fine for cross-checking a hunch, but
   the ROM decides ties.

2. **Never silently upgrade a guess to VERIFIED.** There are currently no
   placeholders left in the core — `reference/NOTES.md`'s PLACEHOLDER section
   reads "Nothing", and keeping it that way is the point. If something new
   can't be traced to the ROM, mark it `TODO(verify)` at its point of use AND
   list it there; when it does get traced, update the comment, the value and
   that table in the same change. Never present an untraced value as
   confirmed — several rules here looked plausible and were wrong.

3. **Core stays platform-independent.** `src/tengen_core.{h,c}` must keep
   compiling with plain `gcc -std=c99`, no GBA headers, no `#ifdef GBA`
   branches. All hardware-specific code (tile/palette upload, REG_KEYINPUT
   reads, audio) belongs in a `gba/` layer that calls into this API — that's
   what keeps `make test` fast and keeps the rules honestly testable. If a
   rule seems to require touching hardware state directly, that's a sign the
   API needs a new return value or callback, not a leak.

4. **Every new rule gets a native test before it gets GBA integration.**
   `tests/test_tengen.c` runs in milliseconds with `make test`. Adding a rule
   (say, the long-bar/undo cheat codes from `reference/NOTES.md`'s TODO list)
   without a test for its documented behavior is how a subtle 6502-carry-flag
   misreading turns into a silent gameplay bug — see how `tengen_try_rotate`
   was only trusted once `test_wall_kick_only_ever_shifts_left` demonstrated
   the actual kick happening, not just "a plausible-looking function."

5. **Cite the ROM in comments, not just in NOTES.md.** A constant or algorithm
   lifted from the disassembly should have a `main.asm.txt:<line>` (or
   `tetris-ram.asm.txt:<line>`, `constants.asm.txt:<line>`) comment right next
   to it in the C source, the same way the existing code does. Someone
   reading `tengen_core.c` alone should be able to find the exact bytes it
   came from without going back to `reference/NOTES.md` first.

## Roadmap (rough order)

1. ~~Bootstrap the platform-independent core + tests~~ — done.
2. ~~Close out every PLACEHOLDER in `reference/NOTES.md`~~ — done. Gravity
   curve, fractional gravity, soft-drop ramp, scoring, level rule and the
   playfield geometry are all traced and tested; that section now reads
   "Nothing".
3. ~~Stand up `gba/`~~ — done. It builds with a stock `arm-none-eabi-gcc`
   (no devkitARM required), boots in mGBA, and `make gba-check` verifies it
   renders and plays rather than merely links.
4. ~~HUD and title screen~~ — done: next piece, score, level, lines, per-piece
   statistics, game over, and a title screen with level select (0-9, the range
   the ROM's own menu allows).
5. ~~Palettes~~ — done, and these are the game's real colours rather than
   placeholders: the palette tables ARE in the disassembly even though the
   tile art isn't. Tracing them also caught a fidelity bug worth remembering:
   settled blocks are background tiles sharing one level-wide palette, and
   only the falling piece and preview are sprites with their own colours.
6. ~~Real graphics~~ — done. `tools/extract_assets.py` pulls the tiles,
   palettes, screen layout and dancer poses out of a cartridge dump
   (`make assets ROM=...`); nothing in the port is drawn by hand. The
   generated headers stay out of version control.
7. ~~Real-hardware boot~~ — done, via devkitPro's `gbafix` vendored in
   `tools/gbafix/`, with `tools/check_header.py` verifying the result.
8. ~~The between-levels dancers~~ — done, with the ROM's own poses and
   cadence, on the banner column the level-up blit clears for them. Their
   individual choreography scripts are still untraced (noted in NOTES.md).
9. Long-bar/undo cheat codes (`reference/NOTES.md` → "Cheat-code state
   exists") — a well-known, well-loved Tengen feature; the RAM layout is
   mapped, the behavior isn't traced yet.
10. The 2P and coop modes. The core already models coop (including its
   12-column field) and two players; only the GBA front end is single-player.
11. The line-clear animation — the core clears rows instantly, the ROM plays
   an animation first (`stageLineClearAnimation`, `lineClearTimerP1/2`).
12. Audio (`setMusicOrSoundEffect` plus the `MUSIC_*`/`SOUND_*` constants in
   `constants.asm.txt`) — lowest priority, gameplay fidelity comes first.

## Build

- `make test` — native core tests, gcc only. The everyday loop.
- `make gba` — cross-compiles `build/tengen.gba`.
- `make assets ROM=/path/to/tetris.nes` — regenerates the graphics headers
  from a cartridge dump. Required once before `make gba` on a fresh clone.
- `make assets-check` — verifies the asset conversion without needing a ROM.
- `make gba-check` — boots the ROM headlessly in mGBA and asserts it draws
  the field where the resolution mapping says it should and that a piece
  actually falls.

Run `make test` and `make gba-check` before considering a change done. The
first catches rule regressions; the second catches the ones that only appear
once the code runs on ARM (alignment, the `-nostartfiles` build, VRAM
layout), which the host tests structurally cannot.
